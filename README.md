# shop-titans-spreadsheet-fetcher
Data fetcher from the Shop Titans spreadsheet. Goal of this project is to provide an API via full typed models to easily work with data from the spreadsheet. If needed there will also be an export functionality to export to JSON.

The ultimate goal is to be a building block for other applications that want to consume this data.
